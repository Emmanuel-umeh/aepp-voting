## Overview

### User stories

- the user can look at the existing proposals and see their current voting status (right now dummy data)
- the user can without logging in submit a new proposal
- the user can vote on proposals and the weight of his vote is defined by his ERC20 tokens on the Etherum Rinkeby testnet (right now by default 5 tokens)
- the user can post a comment to a proposal via disqus

## Tech stack

Core technologies are:
* Vue.js as a front-end framework
* Meteor.js as a backend and a build tool
* MongoDB - database

## Getting the project running

### Installing

```sh
$ meteor npm install
```

### Running

```sh
$ npm start
```

### Vue components
We use file components. A single SomeFile.vue files that contain markup, styles and logic

### VueX
VueX is a kind of a flux architecture for Vue. Basic principles:
* keep the client-side state out of the components. It should be contained in a special reactive states in VueX stores
* no direct store mutations from the components. You should dispatch (commit) actions (here mutations), and the actual logic should happen in a VueX store
That helps to keep logic separate from presentation, encapsulates apps client-side business logic into centralized blocks and
makes an apps code much more transparent and easy to maintain, especially when an app gets larger.

### Styling

'SCSS' pre-processor is used. Styles are contained directly inside vue component files.
Common style files like fonts, mixins and variables and in `/imports/core/ui/styles` folder. They should be explicitly imported inside vue components.
Basic styles should be imported or defined inside top some level component (in our case - MainLayout.vue)

## Project Structure

* "client" and "server" folders are loaded on the client and server respectively
* "lib" folders are loaded first
* "imports" folder holds all the main app's logic, divided into modules

Each top-level feature should be contained in a related module.

Basic module structure:

```
.
+-- moduleName/
|   +-- api/    - logic layer
|   |   +-- store/   - vuex store. all the client side logic, includung actions and state mutation should happen here and only here
|   |   |   +-- module_store.js
|   |   |   models/   - db collection related models
|   |   |   +-- collectionName.js
|   |   |   +-- collectionName_methods.js
|   |   |   +-- collectionName_pubs.js
|   |   |   +-- collectionName_hooks.js
|   |   +-- methods/   - methods, not related to some model
|   |   +-- static/    - static data
|   |   +-- utils/     - utils and helper methods
|   +-- startup/   - some initialization logic
|   |   +-- client/
|   |   +-- server/
|   +-- ui/   - view layer
|   |   +-- layouts/    - components that contain pages
|   |   +-- pages/      - components that have a corresponding route
|   |   +-- components/ - components that are first level building blocks for pages
|   |   +-- particles/  - components that are particles for another components

```

There is a special module called `core`.
It holds app initialization logic, routes, core vuex store and features, shared by other modules.
Holds top level app components like "MainLayout".
Think of in as a master module, and of all the other modules as sub-modules.

It's not mandatory that a module should contain all the specified folders.
There can be presentational only modules or api only modules.

### General structure

```
.
+-- app/
|   +-- client/
|   |   +-- main.html   -   main html entry
|   |   +-- main.js     -   main client entry. generally used to import startup/client from the 'core' module.
|   +-- i18n/
|   +-- imports/
|   |   +-- core/
|   |   +-- someModule/
|   |   +-- someOtherModule/
|   +-- lib/            - loaded first
|   +-- public/
|   |   +-- fonts/
|   |   +-- images/
|   +-- server/
|   |   +-- main.js     - main server entry. generally used to import startup/server from the 'core' module.
